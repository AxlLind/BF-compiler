# BF-Interpreter
An interpreter for the isoteric programming language [BrainFuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck).

Accepts a file name as a program argument or takes in the BF program through stdin.

The main interpreter is a lexer, parser, and interpreter. For a such a simple language like BF this can be done much simpler, which I've also done in `simpler.cpp`.
